AI generated code extractor

Many times LLM appends multiple files into a single one, (with appended comment saying this is a new file) like:
<img width="1530" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83d94103-b773-4ab2-b2e9-aa5454e34b0c">


It is very annoying to create these files manually one by one, 
to avoid such extra overhead here is a utility to automate this.


## How to use?

### Step 1: Simply paste the generated response in 'input.txt'

### Step 2: Simply run 'npm run dev'
  and The generated output should be there in output dir.

### Step 3: Enjoy a sip of Coffee!!

### Step 4: Write me a feedback message
